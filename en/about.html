        The Veil Project was conceived in 2018 by James Burden, a recognized expert in crypto-privacy and holding a track record of founding successful cryptocurrency projects like PIVX. The motivation for Veil was the need for a currency that provided full-time privacy, without compromising strength of anonymity.

       With seed funding in excess of one million USD, a team of leading blockchain developers, cryptographers, mathematicions, user experience and operations personnel was formed. The projectâ€™s mainnet launched in January of 2019.
