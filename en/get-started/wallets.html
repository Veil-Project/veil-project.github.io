    Additionally, there is a
    <a href="https://github.com/Veil-Project/Veil-Paper-Wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper wallet generator</a>
    for both the mainnet and testnet. While a paper wallet generator can run online and offline, as a privacy-centric project, our recommendation is to download and run <b>locally</b>. After paper wallet user feedback we will give this a more prominent position on this page.

  <p>
  Veil’s long-term ecosystem discussions have included ideas such as additional
  <strong>light wallets</strong> and potential integration with
  <strong>hardware wallets</strong> (for example Ledger or Trezor).
  These are exploratory concepts rather than active development commitments.
</p>

<p>
  If hardware wallet support becomes practical in the future,
  it could enable research into models such as
  <strong>delegated or assisted staking</strong>,
  allowing users to stake while keeping keys secured externally.
