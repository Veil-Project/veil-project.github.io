    Veil is available on the following exchanges (listed in chronological order):
  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/BTC-VEIL">TradeOgre</a> - the most liquidity, all genuine. Cheap and fast withdrawals</li>
<li><a href="https://graviex.net/">Graviex</a> - genuine, but lower volume, instant & cheap withdrawals</li>
<li><a href="https://www.stex.com/">STEX</a> - solid exchange, with potential for more volume</li>
<li><a href="https://crex24.com/exchange/VEIL-BTC">Crex24</a> - active trading, but on this check (2022-01-26) the exchange wallet, deposits and withdrawals were paused for maintenance</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bitmart.com/en">BitMart</a> - as the world's largest exchange for certain coins, huge potential volume, but the opportunity for greater volume is lost currently due to closed deposits and withdrawals</li>
<li><a href="https://instaswap.io/">InstaSwap</a> - Veil is listed here, but performance may depend on more available liquidity on other exchanges</li>
</ul>

  <p>
  <strong>Note</strong> — The exchanges currently accept deposits in Basecoin only, and the Veil wallet currently will only send to stealth addresses on the Send screen. Sending Basecoin from the wallet can be done through the Console, as described <a href="https://veil.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/43000474291-different-methods-sending-coins-from-debug-console-">in this support article</a>.
