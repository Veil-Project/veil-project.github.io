    Veil is available on the following exchanges:
  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/BTC-VEIL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TradeOgre</a> - the most liquidity, all genuine. Cheap and fast withdrawals</li>
<li><a href="https://www.probit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probit</a> - an established Korean exchange, still with sporadic Veil volume.

  <p>
  <strong>Note</strong> — The exchanges currently accept deposits in Basecoin only, and the Veil wallet currently will only send to stealth addresses on the Send screen. Sending Basecoin from the wallet can be done through the Console, as described <a href="https://veil.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/43000474291-different-methods-sending-coins-from-debug-console-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this support article</a>.
  </p>

  <p>It is technically possible for the exchanges to allow withdrawals to Stealth (sv) addresses, and the Veil wallet in 2022 was improved to enable users to receive stealth Veil while the wallet is still locked, and to have the amounts appear automatically when unlocking. In 2019 an exchange briefly was letting people withdraw stealth amounts, but support load increased as customers needed to unlock AND go through a procedure in order to see their incoming amounts. This complication has been removed, so exchanges are welcome to try stealth transactions again.</p>
