      Veil is open source. If you want to help, jump in — pick a task, improve something, and ship.
      Many contributions start small and grow from there.

      <strong>How bounties work today:</strong> some issues are tagged as bounties and may include a listed reward.
      We’re actively refreshing the bounty list to match current priorities, so you may see a mix of older and newer items.
      If you’re unsure whether something is still relevant, ask — we’ll confirm and help scope it.
    </p>

    <h3>How to claim or coordinate work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Start on GitHub</strong> — Open the issue and leave a comment saying you want to work on it (or ask clarifying questions).
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Coordinate in the main Discord</strong> — If you want faster back-and-forth, drop a message in Discord and link the issue.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Submit your work</strong> — Open a pull request referencing the issue.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <strong>Bounty payout</strong> — If the issue is funded, we confirm the reward amount and pay once the work is accepted.
      </li>
    </ul>

      If nothing below fits, pick a pain point and improve it:
      docs, build fixes, wallet UX, tooling, website polish, testing, translations, exchange/infrastructure support it all helps.
      Post what you’re working on in GitHub or Discord so others can follow along.
