## Resilience by Design

In a landscape of shifting privacy standards, Veil provides a constant: a secure, highly usable privacy coin where anonymous transacting is the standard. 

The mission is to deliver a practical digital cash experience that maintains a conservative security foundation. Veil is engineered as a self-sustaining network designed for permanent maintainability, high-integrity privacy, and absolute user control.

## Core Pillars of the Stack

### RingCT: The Ecosystem Standard
RingCT is the primary layer for the Veil ecosystem. It is the standard for all currently supported exchanges and light wallets providing full-time privacy by masking both transaction amounts and participant identities. While the network supports multiple coin types for specialized use, RingCT is the engine of the Veil economy.

### Hybrid Consensus and Distribution
Security is balanced through a dual-layer consensus. By combining Proof-of-Work (PoW) for fair distribution with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) for energy-efficient validation, Veil creates a network that is resistant to centralization.

### Network Routing
Privacy goes beyond the transaction. With Dandelion integration, Veil obscures the origin of every broadcast. By scrambling the path a transaction takes across the network, it becomes significantly harder for outside observers to trace activity back to a specific IP address.

## The User Experience

High-level privacy should not be a technical hurdle. 

* **Light Wallet Performance:** Veil light wallets are optimized for RingCT, providing a fast streamlined experience focused on secure transacting. These wallets are designed for everyday use without the storage requirements of a full node.
* **The Single-Seed Standard:** Using BIP-0039/BIP-0044, your financial history from mined Basecoin to private RingCT is secured by one recovery phrase.
* **Deterministic Security:** Restore your whole wallet without managing multiple keys or complex backups.
