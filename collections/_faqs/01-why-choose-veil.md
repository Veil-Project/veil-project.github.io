All privacy-focused cryptocurrencies involve design trade-offs.

Some attempt to enforce privacy by default using approaches that depend on long-term assumptions about anonymity. Others rely on advanced cryptography but permit both private and non-private transactions, requiring users to actively choose how to transact and increasing the risk of mistakes.

Veil is designed around a different approach.

Veil enforces privacy at the protocol level, with RingCT-based transactions forming the standard path for everyday use. While certain network processes such as mining will produce basecoin outputs. The design of Veil converges toward private stealth based transactions as the intended form of circulation. Privacy is not a per transaction option, but a structural property of how the network is meant to be used.

At the same time, Veil is designed with long-term sustainability in mind. The network includes mechanisms intended to support ongoing maintenance, security, and continued research into blockchain privacy. This focus on sustainability helps ensure that Veil can continue to evolve as technology and threats change over time.

We believe this combination privacy enforced by design, paired with a network structured for longevity sets Veil apart. Not simply as another privacy coin, but as a durable foundation for private digital money.
