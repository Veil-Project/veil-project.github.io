title: How do stealth addresses work?

Stealth addresses allow you to publicly post a static receiving address without anyone being able to see the associated transaction history. This is a big improvement over traditional Bitcoin addresses.

To preserve privacy in traditional Bitcoin addresses the receiver has to be careful to never link himself to any of his addresses and preferably generate a new address after every transaction. 

With stealth addresses the receiver does not have to worry about generating a new address after every transaction, or having his name tied to his receiving address. 
This is achieved by deriving a new one-time public key as the destination for every transaction using the receivers address and random data generated by the sender. 
This makes it impossible to link any output (the one-time public key) back to the receiving address, allowing users to have a static receiving address linked to their name, without revealing their transactions.  

At launch Veil will have stealth addresses for Basecoin transactions, with support for Zerocoin to be added at a later date.
