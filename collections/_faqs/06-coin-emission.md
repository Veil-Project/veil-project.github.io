title: What is the coin emission schedule?

Veil uses a capped emission model with a maximum supply of 300 million VEIL.

The network launched with a 50 VEIL block reward, which decreased by 10 VEIL per year until reaching a minimum block reward of 10 VEIL. Once this level was reached, the block reward was designed to remain constant.

Emission continues at the fixed 10 VEIL block reward until the maximum supply is reached, ensuring predictable long-term issuance while maintaining incentives for network security.
