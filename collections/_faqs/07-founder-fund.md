In order to avoid an ICO and pre-mine, the Veil Project has been pre-funded in excess of one million USD by its founder. As a mechanism to recover this investment, a founderâ€™s reward was established, which tapers and expires over a five-year period. (Founders reward ended in 2020 read about it here [Technology](/technology/))

The operations budget was established to fund the team. The Labs budget was established to fund ongoing research and development in the areas of advanced cryptography and blockchain technologies.
