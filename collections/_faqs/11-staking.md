title: What is “staking”, and how does it work?

Veil uses a hybrid consensus model that combines Proof-of-Work mining with Zerocoin-based Proof-of-Stake.

In Veil’s staking system Zerocoins are used to participate in block validation. Wallets holding eligible Zerocoins that are online, fully synced, and unlocked for staking automatically compete to validate new blocks.

When a wallet successfully stakes a block, it receives a staking reward as compensation for helping secure the network.
