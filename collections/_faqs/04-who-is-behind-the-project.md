Veil was founded by James Burden (known in the project as 4x13), a long-time contributor in the cryptocurrency privacy space and the founder of projects such as PIVX. James helped establish Veil’s original vision, architecture, and privacy-first design principles.

Today, Veil operates as an open-source, community-driven project. Development, infrastructure, and ecosystem growth are maintained by a small group of contributors and community members who continue to build on the project’s original foundations. Like many decentralized networks, Veil does not rely on a single individual or central authority for its ongoing operation.
