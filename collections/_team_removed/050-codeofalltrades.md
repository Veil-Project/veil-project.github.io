intro: Jared has worked as a full stack developer since 2009, primarily working on websites, web services, and Windows services. Recently he felt compelled to investigate the open-source world, getting involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency. Jared prides himself on his ability to translate complex development processes into that which is easily understood. He also enjoys mentoring new developers, watching them grow and thrive as a result. Jared lives by his motto, “If you can dream it, I can build it”, applying that attitude to his work on Veil.
