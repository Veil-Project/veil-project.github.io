Version 1.2.3.1, a recommended update, includes the new Mining Tab in the GUI version of the wallet. Users can start, stop, change algos, set mining threads and see the current hash rate. Additional improvements include: CPU hashrate reporting, wallet blockchain optimizations, and locking fixes.

Upgrading is not mandatory, especially if you have already been running a recent wallet from the "master" branch.
The previous mandatory release was version 1.2.2.1 in May 2021.
