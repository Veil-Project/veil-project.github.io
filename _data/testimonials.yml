    en: 'In the current “let’s regulate crypto” environment, we can’t lose sight of what makes crypto revolutionary to begin with—it has to stay permissionless and fungible. Privacy of use is a critical extension of fungibility and safety to  users. Veil is pushing this ethos forward, and has my full support.'
